####_Hello, I am Marche Walter._

Search Influence is an awesome company. The people are welcoming and very nice. They help you get your way through the company. They teach you and work alongside of you. They have daily meetings that track their progress throughout the week and help them learn what tasks are a priority.

In all, Search Influence is a great company to work at and interned with. I look forward with future opportunities involving them.
